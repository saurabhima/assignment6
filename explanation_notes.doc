EXPLANATION NOTES ASSIGNMENT 6

PART I

The implementation was done using two binary heaps ie Min Heap and Max Heap defined as classes with functions as given below:
	
	swim(self, index)
	sink(self, index)
	Remove(self, value)
	smaller_child(self, i)
	put(self, node)
	isEmpty(self)
	size(self)
	GetMin(self)
	IsContain(self, name)
	BuiltMIN_HEAP(self, txtfile)/BuiltMAX_HEAP(self, txtfile)
	print_MIN_HEAP(self)


PART II

The implementation was done using same two binary heaps ie Min Heap and Max Heap defined as classes with additional function as below:
	
	recursion(file, mode, len, align) -	For recursively check data and dump 	into 3 sets of file ie left right and center
	
	write_data(filename)	-	Used to recursively check all center files 	and join them to make one file


The ouput and all sub files ae kept in the Project_Data sub directory

The code has been optimized for Python 2.6.6 on Ubuntu 64 Bit
